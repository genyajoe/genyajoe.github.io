<h3>Survivable Interdependent Network Design</h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;">
The study of interdependent networks is an emerging field to deal with tangled network systems consisting of distinct kinds of network devices and their provisioning relationships. This project is aimed at formulating and providing solutions for survivability problems in interdependent networks based on graph theoretical modeling.

<h3>Cluster Leader Election Problem for Distributed Controller Placement</h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;">
This project deals with the intractability and heuristics of the Cluster Leader Election Problem (CLEP), which is to assign a controller to one of the switches in each cluster of a network. In order to improve scalability in Software Defined Networking (SDN), a network can be clustered into subnetworks and managed by multiple distributed controllers. CLEP deals with the optimal placement of the distributed controllers in the subnetworks considering metrics between the controllers, such as distance and connectivity. Additionally, it is shown that some metrics within each subnetwork, which are discussed in other literature can be guaranteed by selecting specific clustering methods before the placement.

<h3>Distributed network flow algorithm balancing link loads</h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;">
This project proposes a distributed algorithm for congestion control in Software Defined Networking with distributed controllers by exploiting ring structures in a network and graph coloring. Our algorithm dissects a network into small ring units called tie-sets and updates flows on edges by enclosed calculation in each controller, which is in charge of one of the ring units. Additionally, it is shown that the deployment of coloring in a tie-set meta-graph enables the distributed algorithm to avoid update conflicts in shared edges with less communication among controllers.<br>

<h3>Reliable tree composition</h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;">
This project aims at propounding a composition problem of a resilient communication tree on intermittent communication networks such as Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTN). Two types of edge weights called availability and commonality are introduced in order to evaluate the resiliency of trees. Availability represents a probabilistic stability of a communication link corresponding to an edge, and commonality indicates the utilization of each edge based on relative locations on a tree. It is shown that the trees satisfying the proposed ordering property relating to the two edge weights provide more stable connections among communication nodes.<br>

<h3>Controller placement problem in Software Defined Networking (SDN)</h3>    
<ul style="list-style:none;">
This project tries to propose an algorithm to determine a controller location on a given network considering loads of all communication nodes. The load on each node is defined by extending stress centrality, which indicates a load of each node based on the number of edge disjoint paths. Our results indicate that the placement alleviating the load on nodes also improves latency, survivability and path availability metrics.<br>
